The application also predicts the performance of the particular business based ont he sentiments of reviews it recieves over a period of time. Fake reviews and ratings affect the final rating and poplarity of a business. Application also tries to detect fake users and users which kept under the scanner because their behaviour is a bit weird based on their social network, their review history and smillarity of the reviews.\n\nOverlapping Community Detection\nImplemented the algorithm from the paper Efficient Identification of Overlapping Communities to detect overlapping communities in social networks. the algorithm uses the communication graph to find the structure of the communities. This knowledge about the structure is helpful in descovering groups of actors that hide their commmunications, possibly for malicious reasons. the algorithm used produces clusters of a comparable or better quality. The dataset used was Amazon's community graph.\n\nVirus Propogation\nImplemented and algorithm to determine wheather a virus will result in an epidemic or it will die quickly. for a given network of individuals, where the edges represent who can potentially infect whom, the rate of porpogation of a virus across the network depends on the connectivity of the network and on the propogation model of the virus. The result have important inplication for the design and evaluation of immunization policies and can be applied to many problems, such as minimiing the spread od malware in computer networks or maximizing the spread od a makrketing campaign across a social network.\n\nAnomaly Detection in Time Evolving Networks\nAnomaly detection refers to the problem of finding patterns in data which fail to conform to the expected standard. These anomalous patterns is useful to a number of business applications, such as identifying trending topics on social media and suspicious traffic on computer networks, as well as detecting credit card fraud, insurance fraud, and eauction fraud. Implemented the algorithm from the paper: NetSimile: A Scalable Approach to Size-Independent Network Similarity\n\nDatabase:\n\nCourse Registration System\nDeveloped an application for managing course registration, financial details, administrator functionalities while utilizing the concepts of relational databases using Java and Oracle with extensive use of procedures and triggers.\n\nPaperless Hospital Management System\nDeveloped an application for managinng the functionalities of Hospital without the use of paper. The application give the ability to patient, doctors, the pharmacy and diagnostic center to access data. Users could access their medical records whenever they want. Doctors coudl easily look up at the patient's previous records to provide the perfect treatement. Doctors can even access the patients medical records, prescriptions and all the scan details can be added by the diadnostuc center to the patient's account directly, reducing the need of carrying th reports and prescriptions.\n\nLibrary Management System\nDeveloped an application to manage the functionalities of library such as book lending,book availability, reminders for due dates, finincials.

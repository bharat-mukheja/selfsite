var aboutme_writeup = "My name is Bharat Mukheja. I am a passionate Software Developer with expertise in Full Stack Web Development and Data Analysis. My passion for computers started early in my life. After my first tryst with computers, which started with Photoshop, I realized that I had found my first and true love. I primarily used it to create various shapes and produce line graphics. I gradually moved on to the ‘BASIC’ language. I took to computer programming like a fish to water and very soon it became my career path. I was very clear early on that I would become a computer professional.\n\nI did my Bachelors from IIT Roorkee in Electronics and Communication Engineering, which can be considered as my first formal introduciton to high level programming concepts and skills. The courses which I took kept my passion growing and the hunger to learn more never stopped on growing.\nCourseWork - Object Oriented Programming, Data Structures, Computer Networks, Software Engineering.\n\nNew place, new university, new course work did not hold me back form achieving my dream of becoming a Software Developer and I came to the United States to achieve this dream.\n\nI graduated with Masters in Computer Science from North Carolina State University in May 2018, with expertise in Data Science.\nCourseWork - Algorithms, Automated Learning and Data Analysis, Algorithms for Data Guided Business Intelligence, Database Management System, Foundations of Data Science, Internet Protocols, Data Driven Decision Making, Computer Vision.\n\nTo know more about my experience please switch to the experience tab."

var projects_writeup = "Data Science:\n\nIMDb Rating and Gross Income Prediction\nDeveloped a tool for cleaning of IMDb's data and prediction of rating for upcoming movies based on the attributes like actor’s rating, director’s rating, genre using machine learning techniques such as Decision tree, K means Clustering and Neural Networks.\n\nBitcoin Price Variation Prediction\nUtilized machine learning technique of Bayesian Regression in Python to predict the variation in the cryptocurrency useful for bitcoin trading\n\nMarket Segmentation\nDeveloped an application to predict the communities using Facebook’s data using Python, useful in detecting the group of people with similar taste, helpful in recommendation of friends, network analysis and visualization based on the algorithm Structure-Attribute Clustering.\n\nYelp Data Analysis\nBuilt an application to predict the popularity of a restaurant at a particular day and time based on time series analysis on the checkin dataset provided by Yelp using Python and MongoDB. The application also predicts the performance of the particular business based ont he sentiments of reviews it recieves over a period of time. Fake reviews and ratings affect the final rating and poplarity of a business. Application also tries to detect fake users and users which kept under the scanner because their behaviour is a bit weird based on their social network, their review history and smillarity of the reviews.\n\nOverlapping Community Detection\nImplemented the algorithm from the paper Efficient Identification of Overlapping Communities to detect overlapping communities in social networks. the algorithm uses the communication graph to find the structure of the communities. This knowledge about the structure is helpful in descovering groups of actors that hide their commmunications, possibly for malicious reasons. the algorithm used produces clusters of a comparable or better quality. The dataset used was Amazon's community graph.\n\nVirus Propogation\nImplemented and algorithm to determine wheather a virus will result in an epidemic or it will die quickly. for a given network of individuals, where the edges represent who can potentially infect whom, the rate of porpogation of a virus across the network depends on the connectivity of the network and on the propogation model of the virus. The result have important inplication for the design and evaluation of immunization policies and can be applied to many problems, such as minimiing the spread od malware in computer networks or maximizing the spread od a makrketing campaign across a social network.\n\nAnomaly Detection in Time Evolving Networks\nAnomaly detection refers to the problem of finding patterns in data which fail to conform to the expected standard. These anomalous patterns is useful to a number of business applications, such as identifying trending topics on social media and suspicious traffic on computer networks, as well as detecting credit card fraud, insurance fraud, and eauction fraud. Implemented the algorithm from the paper: NetSimile: A Scalable Approach to Size-Independent Network Similarity\n\nDatabase:\n\nCourse Registration System\nDeveloped an application for managing course registration, financial details, administrator functionalities while utilizing the concepts of relational databases using Java and Oracle with extensive use of procedures and triggers.\n\nPaperless Hospital Management System\nDeveloped an application for managinng the functionalities of Hospital without the use of paper. The application give the ability to patient, doctors, the pharmacy and diagnostic center to access data. Users could access their medical records whenever they want. Doctors coudl easily look up at the patient's previous records to provide the perfect treatement. Doctors can even access the patients medical records, prescriptions and all the scan details can be added by the diadnostuc center to the patient's account directly, reducing the need of carrying th reports and prescriptions.\n\nLibrary Management System\nDeveloped an application to manage the functionalities of library such as book lending,book availability, reminders for due dates, finincials. Library Staff and users can login and utilize the system to efficiently manage the functionalities of the library"
